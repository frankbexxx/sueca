SUECA – GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

Target: Text-based Python application
Objective: Accurately simulate real-life Sueca gameplay, including rotation, team formation, dealing methods, trick logic, scoring, and match rules.
Note: No pseudo-code is included yet. This document exists to define all core game rules prior to implementation.


1. Core Principle – Rotation

Sueca always rotates counterclockwise (to the right) during gameplay.
This applies to:
• Playing cards
• Turn order per trick
• Dealer rotation per game
• Shuffling responsibility.

However — during game setup, Method B of dealing requires a temporary clockwise rotation. This single inversion is detailed later in a dedicated section.


2. Game Setup (Real-Life Tournament Logic)

2.1 Choosing Teams (Only if Teams Are Not Predefined)

Shuffle the deck.

Each player draws one card.

Highest card teams with lowest card.

Remaining two players form the second team.

2.2 Choosing First Dealer

Each player draws a card.

Lowest card becomes dealer.

In case of tie → repeat.

2.3 Seating

Once teams are formed, partners must sit opposite one another.


3. Pre-Game Procedures

3.1 Shuffling the Deck

Performed by the player sitting immediately to the right of the dealer.

3.2 Cutting the Deck

Performed by the partner of the shuffler.
This avoids any conflict of interest between shuffle, cut, and deal.

3.3 Dealing Responsibility

After the cut, the dealer manages the deal using one of the two legal methods described below.


4. Dealing Methods – Two Legal Variants

Method A – Standard Dealing (Most Common)

• Deal one card at a time, counterclockwise (to the right)
• Each player receives ten cards
• Dealer receives the last ten cards
• The final card in the deck defines the Trump Suit

Gameplay starts counterclockwise.


Method B – Dealer Receives First Card (Trump Revealed First)

• The dealer takes the first card from the top → this card becomes the Trump Suit
• Then the dealer takes 9 more cards
• The rest of the cards are dealt in clockwise order (to the left)
• All players still receive 10 cards total

Important:
After dealing is complete → all gameplay returns to standard counterclockwise rotation.
This reversal applies only to the distribution of cards in this specific method.


5. Trump Suit Handling

• Immediately after dealing → Trump Suit must be officially announced
• Must be stored in the game state
• Used to determine trick winners


6. Game Flow – Tricks & Rounds

The game consists of ten tricks since each player holds 10 cards.

6.1 First Trick Rule (Special Turn Order)

• The player to the right of the dealer starts the first trick
• Dealer is always the last to play in the first trick only

6.2 Standard Trick Logic

First card played defines the lead suit.

Players must follow the lead suit if able.

If unable, they may play any card.

Trick winner is determined:
 a) If any trump was played → highest trump wins
 b) If no trumps → highest card of the lead suit wins.

Trick winner leads the next trick.


7. Card Values & Game Scoring

Card Value

A      = 11
7      = 10
K      =  4
J      =  3
Q      =  2
Others =  0 (others = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2)

7.1 Game Outcome

• Score > 60 → WIN (1 point)
• Score > 90 → 2× WIN
• Score = 120 → FULL SWEEP → 4× WIN
• Score = 60 → TIE → next game is worth double

7.2 Match System – “Pente”

• Each game victory = 1 match point
• First team to earn 4 total match points achieves a Pente
• A Pente ends the full session


8. End of Game Sequence

After all 10 tricks have been played:

Count captured points

Determine win, loss, tie, or sweep.

Update match score (“pente” progress)

Display results

Ask whether to continue or quit.


9. Suggested Class Structure (No Code Yet)

Game – handles players, rotation, trump suit, current dealer, scoring, match tracking
Player – name, team, current hand
Card – suit, rank, value
Trick – played cards, lead suit, starting player, winning player.


10. Summary

This document defines every functional rule needed to create a real, playable digital version of Sueca. The gameplay must preserve true table behavior, including:

• Counterclockwise rotation
• Two legal dealing methods
• Dealer last on first trick
• Full trick logic
• Official scoring system
• Match tracking leading to Pente

Now this document is ready for development — pseudo-code and class architecture may be drafted next. Tradition is preserved; now logic can begin.


When developers write code for Sueca, they will be programming a tradition — not just a game.

Now it’s time to pseudo-code
